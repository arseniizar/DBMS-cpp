(1) this is the structure of the saved table, then reading it should be put in the constructor of DBMS
(2) in the destructor of the DBMS I should put creation of .txt files with this structure out of
    existing tables

create table table_name(
    col_name col_type (pk)/(fk references ref_table_name(col_name...))
)

insert into table_name
( col_name... )
Values
( val... )

and that should create me a table with values that I had

create table test(id integer primary key, hello nvarchar2)
insert into test(id, hello) values ('1', 'world'), ('2', 'arina')
